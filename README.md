# Project Name: SL PLAYER
    
This web app is built using Vue.js, MySQL, and Python Flask. It utilizes the Spotify API to provide users with the ability to play and download their favorite songs, as well as recognize songs. The user interface is simple and easy to use, allowing users to search for and play songs and download tracks for offline listening.

The backend of the app is built using Python Flask, which communicates with the Spotify API to access song and playlist data, as well as to perform various actions such as playing and downloading songs. It also communicates with the MySQL database to store and retrieve user data. The app is designed to be scalable and secure.
